EOL (DEPRECATED)
===

Since androidx [provides](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-master-dev:activity/activity/src/main/java/androidx/activity/) similar functionality already included with your libraries, this has become unnecessary.

By this point you should've migrated to androidx.navigation which has backpresses implemented by default.

Anyway the library remains functional, but will not be updated anymore.

FragmentBack
============

Tiny library for handling hardware back button click in fragments.


Download
--------

Download the latest JAR:

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/skoumal/maven/fragment-back/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/skoumal/maven/fragment-back/_latestVersion)

or via Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'net.skoumal.fragmentback:fragment-back:0.2.3'
```

Usage
-----

Let your Fragment implement BackFragment interface:

```java
public class MyFragment extends Fragment implements BackFragment {

    public boolean onBackPressed() {

        // -- your code --

        // return true if you want to consume back-pressed event
        return false;
    }

    public int getBackPriority() {
        // use apropriate priority here
        return NORMAL_BACK_PRIORITY;
    }
}
```

Second thing is to delegate back-pressed event in you activity. You have three options:

1. Inherit from BackFragment**AppCompatActivity**

```java
public class MainActivity extends BackFragmentAppCompatActivity {

    // -- your activity code --

}
```

2. Inherit from BackFragment**FragmentActivity**

```java
public class MainActivity extends BackFragmentFragmentActivity {

    // -- your activity code --

}
```

3. Manually redirect back-pressed events

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    public void onBackPressed() {
        // first ask your fragments to handle back-pressed event
        if(!BackFragmentHelper.fireOnBackPressedEvent(this)) {
            // lets do the default back action if fragments don't consume it
            super.onBackPressed();
        }
    }
}
```

### Handle backs in both Activity and Fragments

Sometimes it depends on current circumstances if back-pressed event will be handled in Activity or
in one of your Fragments. Lets try to enhance the example from first point to cover most common
use-cases:

```java
public class MainActivity extends BackFragmentAppCompatActivity {

    // -- your activity code --

    @Override
    public void onBackPressed() {

        if(yourConditionHere()) {
            // handle event here before fragments will get noticed
        } else if(!onBackPressedWithResult()) { // ask fragments to handle back
            // if fragments no don't care about back, handle it here
            if(someOtherCondition()) {
                // handle event here aftter fragments miss theirs chance to consume it
            } else {
                // fall back to default back behaviour
                super.onBackPressed();
            }
        } else {
            // back was handled by some fragment
        }
    }
}
```

### Adjust priority
We support five fragment priorities for ordering back-pressed event delivery:

* VERY_LOW_BACK_PRIORITY
* LOW_BACK_PRIORITY
* NORMAL_BACK_PRIORITY
* HIGH_BACK_PRIORITY
* VERY_HIGH_BACK_PRIORITY

This should cover majority of use-cases. If you need more fine control over priorities, feel free to
increase or decrease priority by number constant. Just keep increment/decrement under 100.

```java
public abstract class BaseFragment extends Fragment implements BackFragment {

    public int getBackPriority() {
        // little bit higher than normal priority
        return NORMAL_BACK_PRIORITY + 1;
    }
}
```
